I received assistance from:Stevie Mayberry

I assisted: Noyal John

1.1:
One of the other services that I use is World Wide Web.
Another service I use is email.

1.2:
I think that the ability to have two different users is helpful and much easier to do. WHen you have this ability is is more organized and alll the information each person has placed won't be mixed 
mixed up and confusing.
 
2.1:
The special symbol tilde is used to represent the home directory of the user that is currently using it and is important because it helps you move to various folders
that contan your personal data.

2.2:

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
 I learned how having two users to be able to use one home directory is useful and how the special tilde is useful and helpful for the home directory

What challenges did I encounter?
I felt like I could never understand the various commands or symbols which are presented through these sections. I had a hard time understanding the special symbols and what 
they did and how they are useful to us.

How could this experience be improved?
I should practice more and more in order to understand on how to perfect these commands.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
